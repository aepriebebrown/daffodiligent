                        <h2>background</h2>
                        <p>I began learning to code in 2001 but decided to pursue degrees in education and English rather than tech. After teaching public school in Mississippi for a few years, I left the classroom to work in the exciting world of online testing, developing multiple-choice and performance-based assessments that are delivered online.</p>

                    <div id="bio-tech-experience">
                        <h2>tech experience</h2>
                        <p>After a minor... well, really kind of major emergency at work left my team without a programmer, database administrator, or web developer, I found myself responsible for designing and building pages on our website and figuring out how our web tools worked so that we could keep operating despite our sudden lack of IT staff.<br><span class="love">And I loved it.</span><br>Thankfully, my organization hired new tech staff, but it was difficult for me to give up the work I had been enjoying so much. About that time, I found <a href="http://www.skillcrush.com/" target="_blank" alt="skillcrush-website">Skillcrush</a>, and I was hooked immediately. I enrolled in <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/front-end-developer/" target="_blank" alt="front-end-developer-blueprint">one Skillcrush blueprint</a>, and then <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/freelance-wordpress-developer-2/" target="_blank" alt="freelance-wordpress-developer-blueprint">another</a>, and then <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/visual-designer/" target="_blank" alt="visual-designer-blueprint">another.</a></p>

                    <div id="bio-personality">
                        <h2>personality</h2>
                        <p>It makes sense that I enjoy coding so much. As an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality" target="_blank" alt="ENTP">ENTP</a>, I am a natural analyst and problem solver. There is nothing I enjoy more than coming up with an elegant solution to a problem. My personality lends itself well to customer service, too, and a big part of my current job is answering helpdesk tickets and customer phone calls related to our testing service. Helping a customer find the answer she or he needs makes my whole day, and it builds trust in my organization. Usually the answers are easy to find - my team has developed manuals for each type of testing that we offer - but other times, the answer means digging into our database procedures to see where things are going wrong and correct them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="bio-customer-service">
                        <h2>customer service</h2>
                        <p>The customer is ALWAYS right, always, <a href="http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/01/27/assume-the-user-is-correct/" target="_blank" alt="customer-service-article">at least a little bit</a>. Even when the customer is wrong, there are ways to help them leave our interaction feeling <a href="http://selfdeterminationtheory.org/" target="_blank" alt="self-determination-theory">autonomous, competent, and related</a>. Most of the customers at my current job are not particularly tech savvy. Most of their support calls are user error. That does not give me license to write them off, though. Every interaction is a learning opportunity for the customer, and I have found that explaining what is happening when the customer is having a tech problem is hugely helpful for both of us. For example, my team has just begun having our users upload .csv files. We use these files to schedule our online tests. The .csv files have to be in a specific format in order for our system to accept them. If they are formatted incorrectly, our web tool generates a list of errors to be resolved prior to reuploading. At first, we received a high volume of calls and support tickets regarding upload errors. My team and I patiently worked through each request, teaching our users to become proficient in Excel and helping them to understand that the computer needs for every field to match exactly in order to know that type of data it is receiving. This went surprisingly well, and our users now have the power to upload their own records instead of having to wait for us to do it for them. This makes the whole process faster for everyone involved.</p>

                        <h2>fav emoji</h2>
                        <p>My favorite emoji is <span class="big-emoji">☹</span>. It is a negative facial expression, but the frown is so exaggerated that it becomes comical. I like it because it is a visual expression of how life's tragedies eventually become comedies.</p>

                            <h5>“I’m considering switching to Product Customizer. Does your app allow live image previews?”</h5>
                            <p>Hi, I am so glad to hear that you are considering making a switch to Product Customizer. I think you will be happy with this decision. We are working to make the live image previews feature available by (x date). Should you switch to Product Customizer, you will be the first to know when the live image preview feature is available.</p>

                            <h4>Imagine you’ve just started your workday. You login and see a large number of emails from distraught customers. Clearly, something is happening. What steps do you take?</h4>
                            <p>First, I would look to find a pattern among the emails to see what the general issue is. Next, I would alert the rest of my team to this issue so that we could get started on a solution. Then, I would pen a canned response to the customers to let them know en masse that we are working on a solution. Once that was sent, I would jump in and work on the solution with the rest of the team. Once the issue was fixed, I would make sure all the emails were answered with a resolution.</p>

                            <p>The last thing I purchased online was <a href="http://www.thecompanystore.com/indira-leaf-wrinkle-free-sheets-bedding-set/ea71-ps-leaf.html#q=indira&lang=en_US&start=1" target="_blank" alt="sheets">bedsheets from The Company Store</a>. I had been looking for some new sheets for a while but had not purchased any as I had not yet found the perfect ones. I saw a picture of some beautiful sheets in a catalog, so I navigated on over to their website and used the dropdown menus to select Shop> Bedding> Sheets. From there, I used the checkboxes to narrow my search to king sheets. I then clicked "View All" at the bottom of the page to avoid pagination. I scrolled until I found my sheets, clicked the image to navigate to the product page, read the description. The sheets were exactly what I was looking for. I selected two pillowcases, a flat, and a fitted sheet. I clicked "Add to Bag", then went to the checkout and used the Guest Checkout to complete my purchase by filling in my shipping and billing information. I clicked "Place Order", and my sheets were on my bed a week later, ahhh.</p>
